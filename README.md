## Two Notebooks for KNN and NDC
These weeks IP contains two notebooks, one note book work on Titanic dataset and perform K-Nearest Neighbor and second dataset on email dataset to perform Naive Bayes Classification.
### Titanic Dataset
RMS Titanic The RMS Titanic, a luxury steamship, sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912, off the coast of Newfoundland in the North Atlantic after sideswiping an iceberg during its maiden voyage. Of the 2,240 passengers and crew on board, more than 1,500 lost their lives in the disaster. Titanic has inspired countless books, articles and films (including the 1997 “Titanic” movie starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio), and the ships story has entered the public consciousness as a cautionary tale about the perils of human hubris.
### Email Texts Classification
The Spambase data set was created by Mark Hopkins, Erik Reeber, George Forman, and Jaap Suermondt at Hewlett-Packard Labs. It includes 4601 observations corresponding to email messages, 1813 of which are spam. From the original email messages, 58 different attributes were computed.
### Steps for achievement
The following steps will be followed in conducting this study: 
Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken.
Read and explore the given dataset.
Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.
Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording our observations.
Performing classification using any of the Naive-Bayes algorithm.
Challenge our solution
